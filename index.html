        <h3>About Me</h3>
         <p>
           Hello viewer! My name is Kelvin Deloney, I'm based out of Chicago, IL. </p> 
           
           <p> I've been in sales for most of my young adult life but have always had an interest in coding and the idea of creating my own games, apps, and websites has always excited me. I'm hoping to become a great software developer who can take on any challenge. </p>
           <p>Outside of software engineering, I'm an avid gamer and enjoy working out and being outdoors, although, I haven't been doing the former or the latter nearly enough during covid for obvious reasons.</p>
           <!--This part definitely felt like the easiest. Simple paragraph tags and only one image. Although, I needed my advisor's help to put the photo in correctly.-->
